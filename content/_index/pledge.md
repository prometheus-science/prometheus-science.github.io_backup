Pledge to the Open Source Community 

 Part of the profits from the services provided by Prometheus Science will be reverted back to the original developers of the open tools replicated in the form of a donation. I believe this is an important way to support the community, as it recognizes previous work and gives an incentive for developers to keep improving their current tools.

Whenever Prometheus Science services are provided using only things developed internally, part of the profits will be donated to an NGO of choice.

If you have questions or suggestions to this pledge, please get in touch using the form below!
